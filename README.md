# Project: IMDB Reviews Sentiment Analysis

Project Overview:
This project focuses on building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. The project leverages a Simple RNN architecture to process sequences of text data. By utilizing the IMDB dataset, which is pre-encoded, the model aims to predict sentiment based on review content.


Dataset:
The dataset used is the IMDB movie review dataset, which is preprocessed and encoded by Keras. It consists of:
- Training Data: 25,000 reviews
- Testing Data: 25,000 reviews
- Features: Sequences of integer-encoded words
- Labels: Binary classification (1 for positive, 0 for negative)


Data Preparation:
1. Data Loading: 
   - Utilized the `imdb` dataset from Keras, limited to the top 10,000 most frequent words.
   - Loaded training and testing data with pre-encoded integer sequences.

2. Data Inspection:
   - Training data shape: (25,000,)
   - Testing data shape: (25,000,)
   - Example review: Converted integer sequence into a human-readable format for better understanding.

3. Padding:
   - Applied padding to ensure all sequences are of equal length (500 tokens).
   - Used `sequence.pad_sequences` from Keras to standardize input length for the RNN.


Model Development:
1. Architecture:
   - Embedding Layer: Converts integer indices into dense vectors of fixed size.
   - Simple RNN Layer: Processes sequences of word vectors and learns temporal dependencies.
   - Dense Layer: Outputs the final classification.

2. Activation Functions:
   - Embedding Layer: No activation (initial representation of tokens).
   - RNN Layer: Utilizes tanh activation.
   - Dense Layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification.

3. Training:
   - Compiled the model with binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
   - Trained the model on the training dataset, validating with a portion of the training set.

4. Evaluation:
   - Assessed model performance on the test dataset using accuracy as the primary metric.


Results:
- The Simple RNN model demonstrated an ability to classify movie reviews with significant accuracy.
- The model was effective in learning patterns in sequential data and generalizing to unseen reviews.


Tools and Technologies:
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy
- Visualization: Not utilized in this basic implementation.

Conclusion:
The RNN model achieved satisfactory performance in classifying movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. It highlighted the capability of RNNs in handling sequential text data and sentiment analysis.


Future Improvements:
1. Model Enhancements:
   - Explore more complex RNN variants such as LSTM or GRU.
   - Implement Bidirectional RNNs to capture context from both directions.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Adjust hyperparameters like the number of RNN units, embedding dimensions, and learning rate.

3. Model Evaluation:
   - Use additional metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for a comprehensive evaluation.
   - Consider using more advanced techniques for model validation, such as cross-validation.

4. Data Augmentation:
   - Investigate techniques to augment the dataset and improve model robustness.


Lessons Learned
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Gained insights into padding sequences and handling text data in neural networks.

2. Model Building:
   - Acquired skills in building and tuning RNNs using TensorFlow and Keras.

3. Evaluation Metrics:

- Confusion Matrix: Analyzed model performance in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.


Challenges and Solutions
1. Handling Variable Length Sequences:
   - Addressed by padding sequences to a uniform length.

2. Model Complexity:
   - Simple RNN may not capture complex dependencies; explored alternative RNN architectures.
